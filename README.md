<h4><a href="https://ooopsdev.com/#/">ooopsDev.com </a> </h4>
<p> oopsDev is a small platform where developers can collaborate and share websites that can assist and save time for other developers. There are numerous websites that can assist web developers, including features like, fonts, icons, and color palettes. Our aim is to serve both new and experienced developers. The goal would be to share websites that other people may find helpful as well. </p>
